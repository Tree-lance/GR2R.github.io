            <h1>Who are we</h1>

            <p class="lead">Hi iâ€™m Jermaine and this is my business partner Kerrie,
              <br>
              <br>
              Welcome and thank you for visiting Guaranteed Rent 2 Rent. We hope from this page you will gain some knowledge and insight about ourselves and Guaranteed Rent 2 Rent. 
              <br>
              <br>
              By way of background I am a Legal Executive (FCILEx) and I specialise in Housing and Family law and have done so now since 2013. 
              <br>
              <br>
               As I deal with Landlords and Tenants on an everyday basis representing them both, whether it's a landlord wanting possession of their property or a tenant complaining about the condition of their property, I am aware of the legal process for dealing with such matters.
              <br>
              <br>
              With my background and my partners expertise of running a business, we have decided to create and build Guaranteed Rent 2 Rent with the sole purpose of providing both Landlords and Tenants a professional service whilst also benefiting from my knowledge of the ever changing Housing laws.
              <br>
              <br>
               Guaranteed Rent 2 Rent is an established, family run Property Management Company which is managed by myself and my partner.
              <br>
              <br>
              Our experience and professionalism combined with our extensive knowledge ensures that we provide a service that is second to none! We work with local businesses to house their professional employees and we specialise in placing professional and corporate tenants in high-quality shared houses (HMOs).
              <br>
              <br>
              We also take on properties and manage them on behalf of the Landlord so they no longer have to deal directly with tenants.
              <br>
              <br>
              The accommodation that we provide are designed specifically for professionals seeking a room to rent on an individual Assured Shorthold Tenancy Agreement.
              <br>
              <br>
              Guaranteed Rent 2 Rent always strives to be fully up to date and legally compliant and is a forward looking business with a great solution for both Landlords and Tenants.
              <br>
              <br>
              Guaranteed Rent 2 Rent is here to help you!

              Experience teaches us that regular maintenance can easily escalate to a substantial cost for landlords. We have our own maintenance team who carry out routine maintenance work on all the properties we manage.

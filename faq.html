        <h6>Revision C: 9 April 2019</h6>

        <h3 id="personal-info">(1)Which areas do you operate in?</h3>
        <p>We operate within the UK and are expanding all the time. If you are not sure as to whether we operate in your area please contact us to find out if we can help.</p>

<h3 id="personal-info">(2) Which types of properties do you take on?</h3>
<p>We take on properties of all sizes. However we are particularly interested in three to six bedroom houses.</p>

<h3 id="personal-info"> (3) Does my property need to be refurbished?</h3>
<p>No not at all, we are happy to dress the property at our expense. 
</p>

<h3 id="personal-info"> (4) How long are the contracts?</h3>
<p>We only take on long-term contracts, currently lasting up to 5 years. The length of the contract can be negotiated during the acceptance of our services.
<br>
<br>
Once we enter the last year of the contract negotiations can be made for renewal or even an option to buy the property at some point in the future if you are looking to sell.</p>

<h3 id="personal-info">(5) How will I get paid?</h3>
<p>Rent will be paid via a standing order on the same date every month for the duration of the agreed contract. 
</p>

<h3 id="personal-info">(6) How quickly can you manage my property?</h3>
<p> After viewing the property, a rental offer will be made within 48 hours. Subject to acceptance, contracts can then be negotiated and signed. In order to allow for any refurbishments, depending on the current condition of the property, payment of the first months rent is normally 4 weeks after the agreement is signed. This period however can be discussed prior to signing any agreement.</p>




<h3 id="personal-info">(7) What fees do I pay?</h3>
<p>There are no fees! We do not take any fees from Landlords and we do not charge tenant finders’ fee or high management fees. We simply pay you the monthly rent in return for letting out rooms on an individual assured shorthold tenancy agreements to our professional clients.</p>


<h3 id="personal-info">(8) Do you have your own tradesmen?</h3>
<p>Yes, we have a team of fully qualified tradesmen to carry out light refurbishments, minor repairs and maintenance work.</p>


<h3 id="personal-info">(9) Who will be responsible for major repair works and safety regulations checks?</h3>
<p>As the landlord this is your responsibility. Section 11 of the Housing Act 1985 sets out the responsibilties of the Landlord whilst it is being rented out. However we will organise the arrangements for works to be carried out, leaving you to just confirm and make the necessary payments where necessary.</p>


<h3 id="personal-info">(10) Will I have to pay for any damages caused by the tenant?</h3>
<p>No, not at all - we will cover all of those expenses.</p>


<h3 id="personal-info">(11) How much wear and tear can I expect to see from a shared house?</h3>
<p>At Guaranteed Rent 2 Rent your property will suffer no damage whilst in our care.  At the end of the 5 year contract, the property is normally in a better condition than if rented by a typical letting agent. This is because we are scrupulous about who we let into the property, we have a cleaner who attends our properties on a monthly basis and we also carry out any minor maintenance repairs at our cost throughout the duration of our contract.</p>


<h3 id="personal-info">(12) Will I still have to deal with the tenants?</h3>
<p>No, we will deal directly with all tenants as part of our property management service.</p>

<h3 id="personal-info">(13) Will my rent still be paid if the tenant is late on payment?</h3>
<p>Yes, we guarantee you will receive your rent on time every month, regardless of late/missing payments from tenants. That is our responsibility not yours.</p>


<h3 id="personal-info">(14) Do you pay a deposit?</h3>
<p>We don’t usually pay a deposit to you as each person who takes a room will pay an individual deposit to us that is equal to one month’s rent. We are members of DPS (Deposit Protection Service) and register the tenants’ deposit with the DPS for the duration of their stay, to safeguard against damage to the property which protects you.</p>


<h3 id="personal-info">(15) I have some friends who are also landlords, could you help them too?</h3>
<p>Yes we could. If you are satisfied with our service and have friends who are also landlords, we can offer them the same service should they require our assistance.
</p>


<h3 id="personal-info">(16) What input will I have in the property - once I sign the contract with you?</h3>
<p>Once we take over the tenancy at the property, we will pay you the agreed rent each month via standing order, and we will give you updates on inspections and any maintenance required, including gas safety checks. We take all the hassle out of being a landlord, no tenant issues, no voids, no missing rents- just guaranteed rent and peace of mind. However if you would like to visit the property to do your own inspection you are free to do so. All we require is at least 48 hours notice.  
</p>


<h3 id="personal-info">(17) What if my circumstances change and I want to get my house back?</h3>
<p>That’s ok - we can put a break clause in our contracts and we are always willing to be understanding and flexible wherever we can. We need to ensure that we treat everyone correctly including the tenants in the property. As long as we are able to allow them enough time to leave and serve the correct notices regulated by law.
<br>
<br>
We would ask our landlords to give us a minimum of 6 months’ notice if they do not intend on renewing the contract at the end of the term, and we will do the same. We ask for this notice period to allow our tenants to find a new home without the stress of having to do it in a short time frame.
